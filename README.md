Made with C++ in Xcode by Ariadna Cortés Puig.

It's a text mode conversational game, it's been done in less than a week to test C/C++ knowledge to access ADVANCED PROGRAMMING FOR AAA VIDEO GAMES master in UPC.  

The game consists of 7 rooms plus the initial room. The player starts in room 0 where he/she will be given an explanation of the commands he/she can use. The player has an associated a health number that will vary according to the hits he/she receives and the potions he/she takes.
The rooms have NPC, Items and an Exit in them. 
### NPC: 
 · Friendly: They won't attack you and you can't attack them.  <br/>
  · Enemys: They will attack you and you should do the same <br/>
### Items can be used by the player: 
  · Swords: To hit Enemys (NPC) <br/>
  · Backpacks: To increase player's inventory space.  <br/> 
  · Enemies: They will attack you, and you should do the same <br/>
### Items can be used by the player: 
  · Swords: To hit Enemies (NPC) <br/>
  · Backpacks: To increase player's inventory space. <br/>
  · Potions: To increase player's health.<br/>
  
The player will be able to:  <br/>
  · Grab and drop objects from the scene to inventory and vice versa  <br/>
  · Look around to see the entities that are on his/her room. <br/>
  · Move to the next room or the previous one. <br/>
  · See his stats, so take a look at it's health and inventory. <br/>
  · Use potions and backpacks, as described before. <br/>
  · Hit NPC that are on his/her room. <br/>
  · Interact with NPC that are on his/her room. <br/>
  
## How to finish the game (for speed runners): 
The rooms are consecutive, so no map needed :) <br/>
On the first room you will find a note, 'open' it or acces it at any point tyiping 'note'. <br/>
When going to the second room, you will find a wood sword, 'grab' it. Go to 'next' room, a biggoron surprises you, you have to kill him! 'Hit' him with the 'wood sword'. Once is dead 'grab' the potion that is on the room and 'use' it to recover health, after that exausting fight. <br/>
Go to next room, 'grab' the 'leather bad' and 'use' it to store more items. Now you will be able to 'grab' the 'iron sword' and the 'potion'. Go to next room, oh no! atacked again, and this one is tougher! 'Use' the 'potion' to recober from that hit. Once you win him, go to next room. <br/>
You will find a potion defently a deserved one, 'use' it. There's also a cat! He is adorable, touch him, a little more, keep peting him...maybe he has something to say. <br  · Move to the next room or the previous one. <br/>
  · See his stats, so take a look at its health and inventory. <br/>
  · Use potions and backpacks, as described before. <br/>
  · Hit NPC that are on his/her room. <br/>
  · Interact with NPC that are on his/her room. <br/>

You will find a potion! definitely a deserved one, 'use' it. There's also a cat! He is adorable, touch him, a little more, keep petting him...maybe he has something to say. <br/>
Let's go to the final Room, here is a dude named Ganondorf (sounds familiar...) he will attach you. You can try to 'interact' with him, but his no really into all of that. You will have to 'hit' him and defeat him, to do that you find a Master Sword in the room, that looks powerful, use it to defeat him! <br/>

## Authors comments:
Developing a game in 4 days is something I have never faced before, to get it right, complete and bug free, is quite an achievement.  <br/>
I have programmed computer graphics, and 2d and 3d video games in visual studio, but never from scratch and in less than a week. As I was programming I was thinking about all the features that could be implemented, closed doors, different types of friendly NPC, being able to use a shield, improving the get input response system, having a pet that follows around... but the time was limited, and I'm proud of the result. <br/>
To use GitHub was never mandatory on the degree or really promoted by the teachers, so I am learning and I want to continue to do so on the master. The game has clear references to other games and films that have been really important to me since I have memory, really happy about seeing a piece of me in the game.  <br/>
